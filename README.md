# Miss You Amy Android App

An Android App that was developed for the *Lesson 12 Project* of the [Udacity Grow with Google Class](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud834-gwg)

Here is a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8QBv1a88E) that shows my narration of the concept and design.

Here is my hand drawn the design.
